\section{Introduction}
NPSGD was designed to to make it easy to add new models. Within a NPSGD, a
``model'' is a Python class that inherits from a specific
base class. This class often is a wrapper for an existing implementation of a
model in another language such as C++ or Matlab. By editing these model wrappers, NPSGD
will create a create the web interface with the corresponding parameters. It is up to the
module to perform the work of running the model and giving meaningful output to
the user.

\section{Quick Start}
The Python model wrappers of NPSGD are located in the \path{models/}
subdirectory an extension of \texttt{.py}. To quickly implement a model wrapper,
simply copy \path{example.py} to a
new filename called \path{my\_model.py}. Edit this file and assign the
\path{short\_name} class variable to \path{my\_model}. Your model will now be
accessible to all of the NPSGD daemons. In particular, you will be able to
access \texttt{my\_model} via the \texttt{npsgd\_web} daemon at 
\url{http://npsgdserver:8000/models/my_model}.

Please note that you will have to make sure that the model is available on all
servers running NPSGD daemons (queue, web, and workers) for NPSGD to function
correctly.

\section{Models}
In NPSGD, a ``model'' is actually a Python class that inherits, 
from the base class of \mclass{ModelTask}. This gives the user the
flexibility to be language-agnostic in terms of model implementation, with a
quick Python wrapper as a model runner.

All model wrappers (with a .py extension) are placed in the \path{models/} subdirectory.
Periodically, the \textbf{queue}, \textbf{web},
and \textbf{worker} daemons will scan this directory for conforming (or newly
timestamped) classes and load them into memory. From there, the model will be
immediately accessible from the web, and therefore from the worker and queue. By
default, the scanner propagation time is 120 seconds. If the wrapper file is
ever removed, the model will continue to be served in memory so that older
requests can complete.

Model wrappers are loaded with an associated ``version'' - a MD5 hash of the
file that was used to declare the model wrapper. All requests in NPSGD are keyed
by both the model name and this version value. When a requests comes in from the
web page, a hidden parameter is sent telling the \texttt{npsgd\_web} what
version of the model the user was looking at. This allows for you to update the
models on disk without destroying requests that are are already in memory (since
they will execute under the old version).

The model versioning also allows worker machines to have a subset of the models
available to the queue and web machines. When a worker polls the queue, it gives
the queue a list of supported model-version pairs. The queue will only return
requests that were made with models available in this list.

\section{Helper classes}
\label{sec:helpers}
Rather than inheriting from \mclass{ModelTask} directly, NPSGD provides two
helper classes that can greatly speedup creation of models. These are
\mclass{StandaloneTask} and \mclass{MatlabTask}.

\subsection{StandaloneTask}
Models inheriting from \mclass{StandaloneTask} are wrappers for standalone executables
that communicate using command line arguments (e.g., specifying the path to
specific data input). When such a model executes the pre-requisites are prepared
in the working directory and a subprocess is spawned using the executable and
command line parameters. 

\subsection{MatlabTask}
\mclass{MatlabTask} aids in connecting models that were programmed in Matlab. Essentially, this
allows the user to access web parameters \textit{directly} in Matlab code,
bypassing the need worry about technical details such as spawning subprocesses
to run the model.

\section{NPSGD Pipeline}
The purpose of NPSGD is to perform all the administrative work needed to deliver
data to your model implementation. It is useful to understand exactly the
processes that occurs in order for this to happen, though the model implementor
will not have to touch this pipeline at all.
\begin{enumerate}
   \item A model that is implemented in \path{models/example.py} is noticed and
   loaded by all NPSGD daemons.
   \item Online web user visits the web interface for the model, typically at
   \url{http://npsgdserver:8000/models/example}. The user specifies all the parameters
   present in the model and clicks submit.
   \item Web daemon \textbf{npsgd\_web} submits the request to the queue.
   \item Queue daemon, \textbf{npsgd\_queue} sends an email to the user with a
   confirmation code for the request.
   \item User receives email, clicks the confirmation code link which is
   typically \url{http://npsgdserver:8000/confirm_submission/code}. The web
   daemon submits the confirmation code to the queue daemon at this time.
   \item Queue daemon waits for a worker to poll. When a worker polls with this
   model available, queue will hand off the request. 
   \item Worker spawns the model class with the parameters that were specified
   in the web interface. Model proceeds with model pipeline documented in
   Section \ref{sec:ModelPipeline}.
   \item Model pipeline completes, sends an e-mail to the user and then tells
   the queue that everything has completed successfully.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Model Pipeline}
\label{sec:ModelPipeline}
The model pipeline is the section that a model implementor will actually have to
create in the model. Typically, these follow a strict order that is specified in
\mclass{ModelTask} class under the method \mmethod{run}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A working directory is created for the model (usually
    \path{/var/tmp/npsgd/unique\_id}. 
    \item Execution is setup in the \mmethod{prepareExecution} method. This is
    generally done by converting parameters into a form (e.g., a file in the
    working directory) that the model can work with.
    \item The model is run under the \mmethod{runModel} method. A typical model
    run includes calling the subprocess with specified parameters and waiting
    for the result.
    \item Graphs are prepared under the \mmethod{prepareGraphs} method using the
    data that was outputted from runModel.
    \item PDF document is created in \mmethod{generatePDF}, through
    \mmethod{getAttachments} using PDFLatex. 
    \item E-mail is sent using \mmethod{sendResultsEmail}.
\end{enumerate}

If any of these stages fail, a message will be communicated back to the queue
telling it that it failed to execute the task. The queue will recycle the request a
fixed number of times (in case the error is transient) and will send an error
e-mail eventually if it continues to fail.

Note that the pipeline can be greatly simplified by using the helper classes 
outlined in Section \ref{sec:helpers}.

\section{Model Implementation}
This section is a basic guide about specifying a model to run.

\subsection{Defining a class}
A model must inherit from \mclass{ModelTask}, or one of
the specialized helper classes specified in Section \ref{sec:helpers}. The model
must be saved under \path{models/my\_model.py}. For example, a skeleton
model could take the form of
\begin{lstlisting}
    from npsgd.model_task import ModelTask
    from npsgd.model_parameters import *

    class MyModel(ModelTask):
        short_name = "my_model"
        full_name  = "My Model"
        subtitle   = "Super example model"
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Parameters}
All model parameters are specified in
the class structure itself, in a list with the name \path{parameters}. As an
example to start, we could specify an integer representing the number of samples
to take into account during a simulation, with a default of 1000:
\begin{lstlisting}
    ...
    class MyModel(ModelTask):
        ...
        parameters = [
            ...
            IntegerParameter('nSamples', description="Number of samples to specify",
                default=1000)
            ...
        ]

\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Parameter Options}
All parameters support a variety of different options in order to modify its
behaviour. The first value passed into the parameter is always the
\texttt{name}, which is used as a reference through NPSGD. The rest of the
options are specified using keyword arguments. Each parameter type outlined in
Section \ref{sec:ParameterTypes} has a superset of these options:\\
\begin{tabular}{ r p{4in} }
    \textbf{Option} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \hline
    name & Unique identifier used to reference the parameter through NPSGD.
           These generally should not have spaces, and by convention are camel
           cased. \\
    description & As it says, used to describe the parameter. The string
                  specified here will appear in a number of places, including
                  the output \LaTeX\ document, and the HTML page. \\
    default & Used to specify the default value of a parameter. \\
    hidden  & Boolean used to toggle whether the parameter is hidden or not.
              Currently, this only affects the output HTML. Hidden parameters will simply
              be passed along with their default value. This is useful for
              subclassing models\\
    helpText & Used to give ``helpful hints'' when a user is specifying the
               model. This currently appears as balloon text on the HTML output
               page.
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Parameter Types}
\label{sec:ParameterTypes}
Currently, NPSGD supports the following parameter types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \mclass{StringParameter}: Basic string input. The only extra option is
              \mclass{units}, which represents the units of input.

    \item \mclass{FloatParameter}: Basic float input. Float parameters can be
              used to specify a specific range of inputs by specifying the
              \mclass{rangeStart}, \mclass{rangeEnd} and \mclass{step} inputs. If both
              \mclass{rangeStart} and \mclass{rangeEnd} are specified, the float
              parameter will function as a slider. If only \mclass{rangeStart} or
              \mclass{rangeEnd} are specified, the input will be clamped to values
              accordingly. Additionally, floats take a \mclass{units} parameter that
              can be used to specify the units of the float (\textit{e.g.,} nm, cm)

    \item \mclass{IntegerParameter}: Basic integer input. Integers have exactly
              the same options as \mclass{FloatParameter}, but will be verified to
              ensure the number is an integer.

    \item \mclass{RangeParameter}: Range parameters are used for specifying a
              range of floating point inputs (\textit{e.g.,} 400-2500nm). Options for
              \mclass{RangeParameter} match \mclass{FloatParameter}, but must
              have all of \mclass{rangeEnd}, \mclass{rangeEnd} and \mclass{step}
              specified. The output and default values of a range must be
              specified as a pair of floats, \textit{e.g.,} \mclass{default=(1,5)},
              representing the range of choices.

    \item \mclass{SelectParameter}: Select parameters are used to clamp input to
              a specific set of options, something like a combo box. Select
              parameters have an option called \mclass{options}, which is a list
              of valid inputs that the select box can take (\textit{e.g.,} ``Strong'',
              ``Weak'').

    \item \mclass{BooleanParameter}: Boolean parameters are similar to the
              \mclass{SelectParamater} type, but now are clamped to true/false. 
              These parameters will display as text boxes in HTML and have no
              additional options.
\end{itemize}

All parameter types are declared in \path{npsgd/model\_parameters.py}. Custom
parameter types could be based off these examples and declared in any file that
is accessible to the model.

\subsubsection{Attachments}
\label{sec:attachments}
By default, NPSGD includes only the PDF created via \LaTeX, outlined in Section
\ref{sec:LatexOutput} as an attachment. If your model creates more output (such
as data files, graphs, pictures, etc.) then you may want to add additional
attachments. In NPSGD, this is performed by adding a class variable by the name
of \texttt{attachments} consisting of a list of all additional attachments
within the working directory to include. For example,
\begin{lstlisting}
    ...
    class MyModel(ModelTask):
        ...
        attachments = [picture.jpg, data.txt]
        ...
\end{lstlisting}
The above code listing would include two e-mail attachments (\path{picture.jpg}
and \path{data.txt}) along with the usual \path{results.pdf}.

If you want more flexibility in specifying attachments, consider overriding the
\texttt{getAttachments} method on \texttt{ModelTask}.

\subsubsection{Graphical Output}
After an executable has run, usually a task will create graphs out of the output
In NPSGD, this can be accomplished by saving files in the working
directory by overriding the \texttt{prepareGraphs} method in a model. Python has
an excellent library called \texttt{matplotlib}
(\url{http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/}) which creates graphs that are on-par
with Matlab's using commands that are almost identical to Matlab plot syntax.
For example,
\begin{lstlisting}
    ...
    import os
    import matplotlib
    matplotlib.use("Agg") #suppress graphical user interface
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    ...
    class MyModel(ModelTask):
        ...
        attachments = [plot.png]
        ...
        def prepareGraphs(self):
            x = [1,2,3,4,5]
            y = [10,5,2,6,7]
            plt.clf() #clear previous plot
            plt.plot(x,y)
            plt.xlabel("X")
            plt.ylabel("Y")
            plt.title("Demo Plot")
            plt.savefig(os.path.join(self.workingDirectory, "plot.png"))
        ...
\end{lstlisting}

Note that the \texttt{prepareGraphs} method is completely optional - if your
model does not have graphical output, or creates the output inside the
executable then you may include the relevant files using the attachment mechanism
outlined in Section \ref{sec:attachments}.


\subsubsection{\LaTeX\ Output}
\label{sec:LatexOutput}
Output for all models is generally routed through \texttt{pdflatex}. Each model will
\textbf{definitely} want to override the \texttt{latexBody} method. This method
returns a string that is inserted into the \LaTeX\ template available in
\path{templates/latex/result\_template.tex}. The resultant tex file is then run through 
\texttt{pdflatex} in order to generate a file
called \path{result.pdf}. This file, by default, is included in every e-mail
that is sent out.

\mclass{ModelTask} has a method for creating a \LaTeX\ table containing
all the parameters that the user has specified. By including
\texttt{self.latexParameterTable()} somewhere in the \LaTeX\ output the output
PDF will contain a very nicely formatted parameter table.

A complete example:
\begin{lstlisting}
    ...
    class MyModel(ModelTask):
        ...
        def latexBody(self):
            return r"""
            Hello there!

            \section{Main Section}
            This is the result of an example model run for NPSGD. Your
            parameters were:

            %s
""" % self.latexParameterTable()
\end{lstlisting}

It is highly recommended that you use Python docstrings (triple quoted strings)
in order to specify output, as well as using the \texttt{r} prefix to the string
(raw string mode, so you do not have to escape slashes).

\subsubsection{Reading Parameter Values}
When executing your script, preparing graphs and outputting \LaTeX\ it is often
necessary to have access to the parameters that the user has specified at the
web interface. These are \textit{automatically} delivered to the script using
the names that you specified in for your parameters. By accessing
\texttt{self.parametername.value} in any instance method, you will get access to
the value that the user specifies. This is best illustrated by example:

\begin{lstlisting}
    ...
    class MyModel(ModelTask):
        ...
        parameters = [
            ...
            IntegerParameter('nSamples', description="Number of samples to specify",
                default=1000)
            ...
        ]

        def prepareGraphs(self):
            print self.nSamples.value #Will output the number of samples the
                                      #user specified

\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Helpers: StandaloneTask}
Subclassing \mclass{StandaloneTask} automates the process of running a
subprocess in order to execute a model on the command line. This is the most
technical part of the process.

\mclass{StandaloneTask} specifies a method of \texttt{runModel} that simply
executes a command as a Python subprocess, and stores the stderr/stdout of the
subprocess in instance parameters \texttt{self.stdout} and \texttt{self.stderr}.
The subprocess is executed within the model's working directory. 

The model creator must specify one additional parameter, and one additional
method for running. The class variable \texttt{executable} specifies the path to
the executable we wish to run (typically the model executable, or something like
\texttt{java} for a Java task). The instance method \mclass{executableParameters} returns
a list of parameters for the executable along with values. The parameters are
specified as a Python list. A developer might take the values specified in the
parameter list for the model wrapper to pass in values to the underlying script. This is best shown via example:

\begin{lstlisting}
    from npsgd.model_task import StandaloneTask
    from npsgd.model_parameters import *

    class LsModel(StandaloneTask):
        ...
        executable = "ls"
        ...
        def executableParameters(self):
            return [
                "-al",
                "/var/tmp"
            ]
\end{lstlisting}

Such a model will execute \texttt{ls -al /var/tmp} in a subprocess and return the results in
\texttt{self.stdout}. Many more examples ship along with NPSGD.

\subsubsection{Helpers: MatlabTask}
Subclassing \mclass{MatlabTask} automates the process of spawning a Matlab
subprocess, which can be a tricky and time consuming process. It also delivers
the parameter values \textbf{directly} into the Matlab environment. The script
will just ``magically'' have access to all the values of user input in variables
that match the names specified in the model class. For example, if you declare a
parameter named ``myInt'' and the user specifies a value of ``5'', your Matlab
script will execute in an environment where the ``myInt'' variable is assigned
5.

NPSGD implements parameter delivery by creating a wrapper script on the fly that
is fed into Matlab. This Matlab script has all the assignment statements for the
parameters passed in and finishes with a call to the function that you specify,
as described below.

A user of the \mclass{MatlabTask} helper need only specify one additional class
parameter, namely \texttt{matlabScript} which gives the location of the script
Matlab should execute. A full example of using \mclass{MatlabTask} is specified
in Appendix \ref{sec:MatlabExample}.
