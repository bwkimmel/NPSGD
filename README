Natural Phenomena Simulation Group Distributed (NPSGD)

NPSGD is a web framework for long running scientific models 
running on distributed worker machines.

The framework has been designed to allow you to run models for any language
by spawning subprocesses. For matlab scripts, NPSGD includes an easy way
to deliver variables "magically" from the web to your script's door. It is likely
that no modifications will be required.

NPSGD is available under a BSD-style license. See LICENSE for details.

A demo of the software is available here: http://www.npsg.uwaterloo.ca/models/ABMU.php

System Requirements:
  - Python 2.5 or higher (http://www.python.org/)
  - The Tornado Web server for Python (http://www.tornadoweb.org/)
  - Matplotlib for Python (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)
  - A LaTeX distribution of some form (e.g. texlive)
  - UNIX-like operating system. NPSGD has been tested on Ubuntu Linux 9.04 and 10.04

Quick start:
  - Clone a copy of NPSGD
  - Copy NPSGD/config.example to NPSGD/config.cfg and configure the email server
  - Download and compile a copy of ABMU/ABMB from 
    http://github.com/cosbynator/ABM-U-and-ABM-B-CPP
  - Edit models/abmu_c.py and change 'executable' to your compiled location
  - Start servers: "python npsgd_web.py", "python npsgd_queue.py" and
    "python npsgd_worker.py"
  - Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see available models and run abmu_c
  - See full documentation for more details
