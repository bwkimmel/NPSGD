Natural Phenomena Simulation Group Distributed (NPSGD)

NPSGD is a web framework for long running scientific models 
running on distributed worker machines.

The framework has been designed to allow you to run models for any language
by spawning subprocesses. For matlab scripts, NPSGD includes an easy way
to deliver variables "magically" from the web to your script's door. It is likely
that no modifications will be required.

NPSGD is available under a BSD-style license. See LICENSE for details.

This software is currently deployed on the homepage of the Natural
Phenomena Simulation Group. See a sample here:
